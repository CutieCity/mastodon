# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability (a bug that allows
something to happen that shouldn't be possible) caused by a code change in
**this particular fork** of Mastodon, **[please report it privately]** so that
it can be fixed ASAP.

Please **do not** report such issues in public spaces. Doing so will only expose
our users to increased risk while we work to fix the issue. Thank you in advance
for your understanding and compliance! ðŸ’œ
